# Finance Dashboard - Documentation

This repository contains the implementation of a dashboard for a financial system, developed as part of a selection test. Below, you will find details about my choices of visualization, the design rationale adopted, and the challenges faced during development.


## How to Install and Run

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) 

### Installation

This will start the development server, and you can view the app in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## Visualization and Design Choices


### Design Rationale

#### Time Constraints

One of the primary challenges faced was the time constraint. Given the limited time available, I had to carefully plan and prioritize tasks. Unfortunately, this constraint affected the depth of certain features, such as user interaction and unit testing.

#### Chakra UI and Financial App Experience

My limited experience with Chakra UI and financial applications posed additional challenges. I had to strike a balance between creating a functional dashboard and navigating the learning curve associated with new technologies.

#### Lack of Official References

The absence of official references on the staging platform required me to rely on external resources and base my design on a specific financial app screen found on the internet.

## Implemented Features

Considering the time constraints and the need to deliver a functional dashboard, I focused on implementing what I deemed essential for a financial platform:

- **Financial Movements**: A detailed view of financial movements, providing insights into transactions.
- **Overall Summary**: A summarized view of key financial metrics.

## Future Considerations

Due to time limitations, certain advanced features, such as upcoming bills or overdue alerts, were not implemented. Future iterations could explore these features to enhance the dashboard's functionality.

Thank you for considering this documentation. I appreciate the opportunity to showcase my skills and look forward to any feedback.
